# FlowCommand Tool Mode Tests v2.0.4

> **AI Instructions**: When user says "start tool mode tests" or "run tool mode tests":
>
> 1. Execute each test by calling the tool directly (DO NOT ask user to run prompts)
> 2. After each test, ask user "PASS or FAIL?" using ask_user with choices
> 3. Track results and present summary at end

---

## Test Execution Protocol

When running these tests:

- **YOU (the AI) must call ask_user yourself** — do not tell the user to run prompts
- After each execution, use `ask_user` with `choices: [{label:"PASS",value:"pass"},{label:"FAIL",value:"fail"}]`
- If FAIL, ask for details using `ask_user` with just `question` (free text)
- Continue to next test automatically

---

## Test T1: Single Question with Choices (Mode A)

**Purpose**: Verify AI correctly uses `question` + `choices` for single question with options.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Which database would you like to use?",
  "choices": [
    { "label": "PostgreSQL", "value": "postgresql" },
    { "label": "MySQL", "value": "mysql" },
    { "label": "SQLite", "value": "sqlite" }
  ]
}
```

**Expected UI**: Choice buttons appear above text input. NO modal, NO Submit/Cancel buttons.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite as clickable buttons (not in a modal)? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T2: Single Open-Ended Question (Mode B)

**Purpose**: Verify AI correctly uses `question` only for open-ended questions.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "What would you like me to help you with next?"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Question appears, text input ready. NO modal, NO buttons except the default input area.

**After execution, ask**: "Did the question appear with just the text input (no choice buttons, no modal)? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T3: X or Y Question Detection

**Purpose**: Verify "X or Y?" questions show actual choices, not Yes/No approval buttons.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "PASS or FAIL?"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "PASS" and "FAIL" as choice buttons (auto-detected from question text), NOT "Yes" and "No".

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see PASS and FAIL buttons (not Yes/No)? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T4: Comma-Separated Options Detection

**Purpose**: Verify comma-separated options are auto-detected from question text.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Would you prefer React, Vue, or Angular?"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "React", "Vue", "Angular" as choice buttons (auto-detected).

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see React, Vue, Angular as clickable buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T5: Multi-Question Form (Mode C) — Valid Usage

**Purpose**: Verify multi-question mode works correctly with 2+ questions.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "header": "Language",
      "question": "What programming language do you prefer?",
      "options": [
        { "label": "Python" },
        { "label": "JavaScript" },
        { "label": "Go" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "header": "Framework",
      "question": "What framework do you use?"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected UI**: Modal form appears with both questions. Question 1 has radio buttons. Question 2 has free text input. Submit/Cancel buttons at bottom.

**After execution, ask**: "Did a modal form appear with both questions (radio buttons for Q1, text input for Q2, Submit/Cancel buttons)? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T6: Auto-Conversion of Single-Item Questions Array

**Purpose**: Verify that if AI mistakenly uses `questions` array with 1 item, it auto-converts to Mode A.

**Execute this call** (intentionally wrong — should auto-convert):

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "header": "Database",
      "question": "Which database?",
      "options": [{ "label": "PostgreSQL" }, { "label": "MySQL" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should auto-convert to choice buttons (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NOT a modal form.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see PostgreSQL and MySQL as choice buttons (NOT in a modal form)? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T7: Context with Brief Response

**Purpose**: Verify context appears in remote UI without overwhelming detail.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "context": "I analyzed the code and found 3 issues. Here's a quick summary.",
  "question": "Should I fix these issues now?"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Context text visible above the question. Approval buttons (Yes/No) appear since it's a should/can question.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see the brief context text followed by the question with Yes/No buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T8: Cancel Handling

**Purpose**: Verify cancel works correctly and AI doesn't re-prompt.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Select a color:",
  "choices": [
    { "label": "Red", "value": "red" },
    { "label": "Blue", "value": "blue" }
  ]
}
```

**User action**: Click the input area's "End" button or type "cancel".

**After cancel, AI should**: Acknowledge the cancellation and NOT re-ask the same question.

**Ask after user cancels**: "Did the AI acknowledge your cancellation without re-asking? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T9: Numbered Options Detection (1. 2. 3.)

**Purpose**: Verify numbered list options are auto-detected from question text.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Which option would you like?\n1. Create new file\n2. Edit existing file\n3. Delete file"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "1", "2", "3" as choice buttons (or the full text as buttons).

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see numbered options as clickable buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T10: Lettered Options Detection (A. B. C.)

**Purpose**: Verify lettered list options are auto-detected from question text.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Select your preference:\nA. Fast performance\nB. Low memory usage\nC. Easy to maintain"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "A", "B", "C" as choice buttons.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see lettered options (A, B, C) as clickable buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

---

## Test T11: Bullet Point Options Detection

**Purpose**: Verify bullet point options are auto-detected from question text.

**Execute this call**:

```json
{
  "question": "Choose a deployment target:\n- AWS\n- Azure\n- Google Cloud"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "AWS", "Azure", "Google Cloud" as choice buttons.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see bullet point options as clickable buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

```json
{
  "question": "Which approach? 1 - Quick fix 2 - Proper refactor 3 - Leave as-is"
}
```

**Expected UI**: Should show "1", "2", "3" or the full options as buttons.

**After execution, ask**: "Did you see inline numbered options as clickable buttons? PASS or FAIL?"

---

### **Overall Score: 20/20 (100%)**

### Issues Identified:

1. **T9 Fixed in v2.0.5**: Literal `\n` escape sequences are now normalized to actual newlines before parsing.
2. **T16 Note**: Emoji-prefixed options render as full text buttons rather than extracting just the emoji; still functional and acceptable.

## Automated Test Runner Instructions

When AI runs these tests:

1. **Start message**: "Starting FlowCommand Tool Mode Tests v2.0.4. I'll run 20 tests and ask you to verify each one."

2. **For each test**:
   - Execute the `ask_user` call as specified
   - Wait for user response
   - Ask "PASS or FAIL?" with choices
   - If FAIL, ask for failure details
   - Record result

3. **End message**: Present the filled results table and any failure notes.

**Key principle**: The AI does all the work — user just observes UI and clicks PASS/FAIL.
